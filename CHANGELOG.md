## Unreleased


## 1.5.2 (2024-09-15)

- Add a cli flag named `--skip-first-run-prompt` that disables the welcome message shown on the first launch of tere, which prompts the user to update their shell configuration for proper directory changing functionality. (Thanks to Timon Schelling, Github #104)
- Update dependencies

## 1.5.1 (2023-08-24)

- Fix output formatting when exiting the app without cd, or when canceling the first run prompt (Thanks @orhun, Github #91, #92)
- Update dependencies
- Improved tests

## 1.5.0 (2023-07-24)

- By default, `tere` now only searches folders and not files. This can be changed with the new `--files` option. This replaces the `--folders-only` and `--no-folders-only` options, which are now deprecated. (Github #87 and #88)
- Deprecation warnings now also get printed to stderr in addition to the in-app info bar
- Search is no longer cleared if changing to a folder is unsuccessful
- If the current folder (or it's parent) no longer exists or is inaccessible, automatically go up the folder tree until an existing folder is found. This way, the current working directory of the app can't be invalid.

## 1.4.0 (2023-01-08)

- Check if the app is being run for the first time (based on whether the history file exists, and a bit of additional simple logic), and if so, prompt the user to confirm that they have updated their shell configuration (Github #83)
- If the app panics/crashes, the terminal state is properly reset, so it shouldn't produce garbled output anymore
- Upgrade `clap` dependency to latest version
- Small improvements to setup instructions and user manual
- Footer error message is not cleared when search is updated, only when changing the folder

## 1.3.1 (2022-12-06)

- Fixed a bug where `?` didn't show the help screen on Windows by default

## 1.3.0 (2022-10-15)

- Add option to toggle filter search mode while the app is running, the default shortcut is `Alt-f` (Github #59)
- Added option to sort directory listing by creation and modification date in addition to the name. Can be changed with the `--sort` CLI option and with the default shortcut `Alt-s`. (Thanks @joshrdane, Github #64)
- Added "normal search anywhere" search mode with the `--normal-search-anywhere` or `-N` CLI option.
- The `--no-gap-search` option has been renamed to `--normal-search`. The old option will still work, but it will display a warning
- Home / end (i.e. `CursorTop` / `CursorBottom`) now work also while searching
- Bugfixes related to drawing (Github #65)
   - Fixed last character of rows not being drawn, both in the main screen and help screen (at least on some terminal emulators)
   - Fixed broken bolding in the help screen if the wrapping happens at `/`
   - Fixed broken highlighting if the last character of a symlink is matched in a search
   - Fixed drawing bug when info message is longer than the terminal window width
- Improved scrolling / cursor position behavior in filter search mode
- Fix footer not updating when pressing home / end

## 1.2.0 (2022-09-11)

The biggest new feature is the possibility to map custom keyboard shortcuts, using a syntax like `--map key-combination:action`.

Other improvements:

- Add keyboard mapping to select the folder under the cursor and exit immediately. The default keyboard shortcuts are `Alt-Enter` and `Ctrl-Space`. (Github #39)
- Fix exiting with `ctrl-c` with `--mouse=on` (Github #45)
- Update dependencies
- Lots of small updates to readme

## 1.1.0 (2022-07-15)

- Typing '~' goes to the home folder
- Added fish example to readme

## 1.0.0 (2022-07-15)

Initial release.
